# DSCS Mod Loader
A dynamic library intended to allow to extending, patching and modifying Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth Comeplete Edition on PC.

It is supposed to be injected using a [custom freetype.dll](https://github.com/SydMontague/DSCS-Freetype) and can by itself load additional [plugins](https://github.com/SydMontague/DSCSPluginTemplate/).

The project is not ready for production or supported in any shape or form. Whatever you do is on your own risk.
There is also no license yet (safe for third party code, such as the MSVC STL implementations). This will be decided at a later stage.
